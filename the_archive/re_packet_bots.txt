This is a small recap of what packet bots in the modern age will get you on RS.

Once upon a time in a land far away, a group of idiots discovered the mystical world of packets and how they work alongside RuneScape. This
typically wouldn't be so significant in an MMO; the interesting part is a server artifact caused by not sending a mouse click packet.
When you sent an interact packet of any sort (i.e. clicking an NPC), without the mouse part, it completely broke the server sided
bot detection.

The exploit didn't last for long obviously. The bot developers released their bot, and Jagex monkeys managed to chain together some packet validation, along
with insta-banning anyone who skipped the mouse click packet.

And that's it! That's how my main with hundreds of hours got banned, and a little bit more insight into the packet bot landscape. Proceed
with caution.
