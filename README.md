# RSBExposed
A collection of tools and research with the sole purpose of dismantling RS bots.
  
Ever wanted to make an RS bot, but you're too stupid to make an updater? Ever wanted to download a paid script to see how it works?
You're in the right place then! You can do all of this with our lightweight toolkit.
  
I will also be dumping research related to existing bot farms, bot technology, and PoCs for detecting bots.  
  
More coming soon..  
  
# Included
The end goal is having support for all bots. While I've already done this for the most part, the code
is not quality enough to be open source IMHO.  

## DreamBot
Hook parsing, and account file parsing are fully functional.
  
## ~~OSBot~~
Complete, need to open-source.  
  
## ~~TriBot~~
Not started.  
  
## ~~RuneMate~~
Not started.
