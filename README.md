# RSBExposed
A collection of tools with the sole purpose of taking RS bots apart piece by piece..  
  
Ever wanted to make an RS bot, but you're too stupid to make an updater? Emulate a big bot on startup, and use their hooks!
  
# Included
The end goal is having support for all bots. While I've already done this for the most part, the code
is not quality enough to be open source IMHO.  

## DreamBot
Hook parsing, and account file parsing are fully functional.
  
## ~~OSBot~~
Complete, need to open-source.  
  
## ~~TriBot~~
Not started.  
  
## ~~RuneMate~~
Not started.
